# Chapter 15 - Hierarchical Preferences

Each RV user has a Preferences file where her personal rv settings are stored. Most preferences are viewed and edited with the Preferences dialog (accessed via the RV menu), but preferences can also be programmatically read and written from custom code via the readSetting and writeSetting Mu commands. The preferences files are stored in different places on different platforms.

| Platform | Location |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | $HOME/Library/Preferences/com.autodesk.OpenRV.plist |
| Linux | $HOME/.config/Autodesk/OpenRV.conf |
| Windows 7 | ~$HOME/AppData/Roaming/Autodesk/OpenRV.ini |

Initial values of preferences can be overridden on a site-wide or show-wide basis by setting the environment variable RV_PREFS_OVERRIDE_PATH to point to one or more directories that contain files of the name and type listed in the above table. For example, if you have your RV.conf file under $HOME/Documents/ you can set RV_PREFS_OVERRIDE_PATH=$HOME/Documents. Each of these overriding preferences file can provide default values for one or more preferences. A value from one of these overriding files will override the users's preference only if the user's preferences file has no value for this preference yet.In the simplest case, if you want to provide overriding initial values for all preferences, you should

1.  Delete your preferences file.
2.  Start RV, go to the Preferences dialog, and adjust any preferences you want.
3.  Close the dialog and exit RV.
4.  Copy your preferences file into the RV_PREFS_OVERRIDE_PATH.

If you want to override at several levels (say per-site and per-show), you can add preferences files to any number of directories in the PATH, but you'll have to edit them so that each only contains the preferences you want to override with that file. Preferences files found in directories earlier in the path will override those found in later directories.Note that this system only provides the ability to override initial settings for the preferences. Nothing prevents the user from changing those settings after initialization.It's also possible to create show/site/whatever-specific preferences files that **always** clobber the user's personal preferences. This mechanism is exactly analogous to the above, except that the name of the environment variable that holds paths to clobbering prefs files is RV_PREFS_CLOBBER_PATH. Again, the user can freely change any “live” values managed in the Preferences dialog, but in the next run, the clobbering preferences will again take precedence. Note that a value from a clobbering file (at any level) will take precedence over a value from an overriding file (at any level).
