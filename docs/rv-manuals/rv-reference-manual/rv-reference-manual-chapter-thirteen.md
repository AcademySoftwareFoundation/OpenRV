# Chapter 13 - Network Communication

RV can communicate with multiple external programs via its network protocol. The mechanism is designed to function like a “chat” client. Once a connection is established, messages can be sent and received including arbitrary binary data.There are a number of applications which this enables:

*   **Controlling RV remotely.** E.g., a program which takes input from a dial and button board or a mobile device and converts the input into commands to start/stop playback or scrubbing in RV.
*   **Synchronizing RV sessions across a network** . This is how RV's sync mode is implemented: each RV serves as a controller for the other.
*   **Monitoring a Running RV** . For VFX theater dailies the RV session driving the dailies could be monitored by an external program. This program could then indicate to others in the facility when their shots are coming up.
*   **A Display Driver for a Renderer** . Renders like Pixar's RenderMan have a plug-in called a display driver which is normally used to write out rendered frames as files. Frequently this type of plug-in is also used to send pixels to an external frame buffer (like RV) to monitor the renderer's progress in real time. It's possible to write a display driver that talks to RV using the network protocol and send it pixels as they are rendered. A more advanced version might receive feedback from RV (e.g. a selected rectangle on the image) in order to recommend areas the renderer should render sooner.

Any number of network connections can be established simultaneously, so for example it's possible to have a synchronized RV session with a remote RV and drive it with an external hardware device at the same time.

### 13.1 Example Code


There are two working examples that come with RV: the rvshell program and pyNetwork.py python example. The rvshell program uses a C++ library included with the distribution called TwkQtChat which you can use to make interfacing easier — especially if your program will use Qt. We highly recommend using this library since this is code which RV uses internally so it will always be up-to-date. The library is only dependent on the QtCore and QtNetwork modules.The pyNetwork example implements the network protocol using only python native code. You can use it directly in python programs.

#### 13.1.1 Using rvshell

To use rvshell, start RV from the command line with the network started and a default port of 45000 (to make sure it doesn't interfere with existing RV sessions):

```bash
 shell> rv -network -networkPort 45000 
```

Next start the rvshell program program from a different shell:

```bash
 shell> rvshell user localhost 45000 
```

Assuming all went well, this will start rvshell connected to the running RV. There are three things you can experiment with using rvhell: a very simple controller interface, a script editor to send portions of script or messages to RV manually, and a display driver simulator that sends stereo frames to RV.Start by loading a sequence of images or a quicktime movie into RV. In rvshell switch to the “Playback Control” tab. You should be able to play, stop, change frames and toggle full screen mode using the buttons on the interface. This example sends simple Mu commands to RV to control it. The feedback section of the interface shows the RETURN message send back from RV. This shows whatever result was obtained from the command.The “Raw Event” section of the interface lets you assemble event messages to send to RV manually. The default event message type is remote-eval which will cause the message data to be treated like a Mu script to execute. There is also a remote-pyeval event which does the same with Python (in which case you should type in Python code instead of Mu code). Messages sent this way to RV are translated into UI events. In order for the interface code to respond to the event something must have bound a function to the event type. By default RV can handle remote-eval and remote-pyeval events, but you can add new ones yourself.When RV receieves a remote-eval event it executes the code and looks for a return value. If a return value exists, it converts it to a string and sends it back. So using remote-eval it's possible to querry RV's current state. For example if you load an image into RV and then send it the command renderedImages() it will return a Mu struct as a string with information about the rendered image. Similarily, sending a remote-pyeval with the same command will return a Python dictionary as a string with the same information.The last tab “Pixels” can be used to emulate a display driver. Load a JPEG image into rvshell's viewer (don't try something over 2k — rvshell is using Qt's image reader). Set the number of tiles you want to send in X and Y, for example 10 in each. In RV clear the session. In rvshell hit the Send Image button. rvshell will create a new stereo image source in RV and send the image one tile at a time to it. The left eye will be the original image and the right eye will be its inverse. Try View → Stereo → Side by Side to see the results.

### 13.2 TwkQtChat Library


The TwkQtChat library is composed of three classes: Client, Connection, and Server.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| sendMessage | Generic method to send a standard UTF-8 text message to a specific contact |
| sendData | Generic method to send a data message to a specific contact |
| broadcastMessage | Send a standard UTF-8 message to all contacts |
| sendEvent | Send an EVENT or RETURNEVENT message to a contact (calls sendMessage) |
| broadcastEvent | Send an EVENT or RETURNEVENT message to all contacts |
| connectTo | Initiate a connection to a specific contact |
| hasConnection | Query connection status to a contact |
| disconnectFrom | Force the shutdown of connection |
| waitForMessage | Block until a message is received from a specific contact |
| waitForSend | Block until a message is actually sent |
| signOff | Send a DISCONNECT message to a contact to shutdown gracefully |
| online | Returns true of the Server is running and listening on the port |

Table 13.1:Important Client Member Functions <a id="important-client-member-functions"></a>

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| newMessage | A new message has been received on an existing connection |
| newData | A new data message has been received on an existing connection |
| newContact | A new contact (and associated connection) has been established |
| contactLeft | A previously established connection has been shutdown |
| requestConnection | A remote program is requesting a connection |
| connectionFailed | An attempted connection failed |
| contactError | An error occurred on an existing connection |

Table 13.2:Client Signals

A single Client instance is required to represent your process and to manage the Connections and Server instances. The Connection and Server classes are derived from the Qt QTcpSocket and QTcpServer classes which do the lower level work. Once the Client instance exists you can get pointer to the Server and existing Connections to directly manipulate them or connect their signals to slots in other QObject derived classes if needed.The application should start by creating a Client instance with its contact name (usually a user name), application name, and port on which to create the server. The Client class uses standard Qt signals and slots to communicate with other code. It's not necessary to inherit from it.The most important functions on the Client class are list in table [13.1](#important-client-member-functions) .

### 13.3 The Protocol


There are two types of messages that RV can receive and send over its network socket: a standard message and a data message. Data messages can send arbitrary binary data while standard messages are used to send UTF-8 string data.The greeting is used only once on initial contact. The standard message is used in most cases. The data message is used primarily to send binary files or blocks of pixels to/from RV.

#### 13.3.1 Standard Messages

RV recognizes these types of standard messages:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| MESSAGE | The string payload is subdivided into multiple parts the first of which indicates the sub-type of the message. The rest of the message is interpreted according to its sub-type. |
| GREETING | Sent by RV to a synced RV when negotiating the initial contact. |
| NEWGREETING | Sent by external controlling programs to RV during initial contact. |
| PINGPONGCONTROL | Used to negotiate whether or not RV and the connected process should exchange PING and PONG messages on a regular basis. |
| PING | Query the state of the other end of the connection — i.e. check and see if the other process is still alive and functioning. |
| PONG | Returned when a PING message is received to indicate state. |

Table 13.3:Message TypesWhen an application first connects to RV over its TCP port, a greeting message is exchanged. This consists of an UTF-8 byte string composed of:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| The string “NEWGREETING” | 1st word |
| The UTF-8 value 32 (space) | - |
| A UTF-8 integer composed of the characters [0-9] with the value **N** + **M** + 1 indicating the number of bytes remaining in the message | 2nd word |
| The UTF-8 value 32 (space) | - |
| Contact name UTF-8 string (non-whitespace) | **N** bytes |
| The UTF-8 value 32 (space) | 1 byte |
| Application name UTF-8 string (non-whitespace) | **M** bytes |

Table 13.4:Greeting MessageIn response, the application should receive a NEWGREETING message back. At this point the application will be connected to RV.A standard message is a single UTF-8 string which has the form:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| The string “MESSAGE” | 1st word |
| The UTF-8 value 32 (space) | - |
| A UTF-8 integer composed of the characters [0-9] the value of which is **N** indicating the size of the remaining message | 2nd word |
| The UTF-8 value 32 (space) | - |
| The message payload (remaining UTF-8 string) | **N** bytes |

Table 13.5:Standard MessageWhen RV receives a standard message (MESSAGE type) it will assume the payload is a UTF-8 string and try to interpret it. The first word of the string is considered the sub-message type and is used to decide how to respond:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| EVENT | Send the rest of the payload as a UI event (see below) |
| RETURNEVENT | Same as EVENT but will result in a response RETURN message |
| RETURN | The message is a response to a recently received RETURNEVENT message |
| DISCONNECT | The connection should be disconnected |

Table 13.6:Sub-Message TypesThe EVENT and RETURNEVENT messages are the most common. When RV receives an EVENT or RETURNEVENT message it will translate it into a user interface event. The additional part of the string (after EVENT or RETURNEVENT) is composed of:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| EVENT or RETURNEVENT | UTF-8 string identifying the message as an EVENT or RETURNEVENT message. |
| space character | - |
| non-whitespace-event-name | The event that will be sent to the UI as a string event (e.g. remote-eval). This can be obtained from the event by calling event.name()in Mu or Python |
| space character | - |
| non-whitespace-target-name | Present for backwards compatibility only. We recommend you use a single “\*” character to fill this slot. |
| space character | - |
| UTF-8 string | The string event contents. Retrievable with event.contents() in Mu or Python. |

Table 13.7:EVENT MessagesFor example the full contents of an EVENT message might look like:

```
 MESSAGE 34 EVENT my-event-name red green blue 
```

The first word indicates a standard message. The next word (34) indicates the length of the rest of the data. EVENT is the message sub-type which further specifies that the next word (my-event-name) is the event to send to the UI with the rest of the string (red green blue) as the event contents.If a UI function that receives the event sets the return value and the message was a RETURNEVENT, then a RETURN will be sent back. A RETURN will have a single string that is the return value. An EVENT message will not result in a RETURN message.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| RETURN | UTF-8 string identifying the message as an RETURN message. |
| space character | - |
| UTF-8 string | The string event returnContents(). This is the value set by setReturnContents() on the event object in Mu or Python. |

Table 13.8:RETURN MessageGenerally, when a RETURNEVENT is sent to your application, a RETURN should be sent back because the other side may be blocked waiting. It's ok to send an empty RETURN. Normally, RV will not send EVENT or RETURNEVENT messages to other non-RV applications. However, it's possible that this could happen while connected to an RV that is also engaged in a sync session with another RV.Finally a DISCONNECT message comes with no additional data and signals that the connection should be closed.

##### Ping and Pong Messages

There are three lower level messages used to keep the status of the connection up to date. This scheme relies on each side of the connection returning a PONG message if it ever receives a PING message whenever ping pong messages are active.Whether or not it's active is controlled by sending the PINGPONGCONTROL message: when received, if the payload is the UTF-8 value “1” then PING messages should be expected and responded to. If the value is “0” then responding to a PING message is not mandatory.For some applications especially those that require a lot of computation (e.g. a display driver for a renderer) it can be a good to shut down the ping pong notification. When off, both sides of the connection should assume the other side is busy but not dead in the absence of network activity.

| Message | Description | Full message value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PINGPONGCONTROL | A payload value of “1” indicates that PING and PONG messages should be used | PINGPONGCONTROL 1 (1 or 0) |
| PING | The payload is always the character “p”. Should result in a PONG response | PING 1 p |
| PONG | The payload is always “p”. Should be sent in response to a PING message | PONG 1 p |

Table 13.9:PING and PONG Messages

#### 13.3.2 Data Messages

The data messages come it two types: PIXELTILE and DATAEVENT. These take the form:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| PIXELTILE(parameters) -or- DATAEVENT(parameters) | 1st word |
| space character | - |
| A UTF-8 integer composed of the characters [0-9] the value of which is **N** indicating the size of the remaining message | 2nd word |
| space character | - |
| Data of size **N** | **N** bytes |

Table 13.10:PIXELTILE and DATAEVENTThe PIXELTILE message is used to send a block of pixels to or from RV. When received by RV the PIXELTILE message is translated into a pixel-block event (unless another event name is specified) which is sent to the user interface. This message takes a number of parameters which should have no whitespace characters and separated by commas (“,”):

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| w | Width of data in pixels. |
| h | Height of the data in pixels. (If the height of the block of pixels is 1 and the width is the width of the image, the block is equivalent to a scanline.) |
| x | The horizontal offset of the pixel block relative to the image origin |
| y | The vertical offset of the pixel block relative to the image origin |
| f | The frame number |
| event-name | Alternate event name (instead of pixel-block). RV will only recognize pixel-block event by default. You can bind to other events however. |
| media | The name of the media associated with data. |
| layer | The name of the layer associated with the meda. This is analogous to an EXR layer |
| view | The name of the view associated with the media. This is analogous to an EXR view |

Table 13.11:PIXELTILE MessageFor example, the PIXELTILE header to the data message might appear as:

```
 PIXELTILE(media=out.9.exr,layer=diffuse,view=left,w=16,h=16,x=160,y=240,f=9) 
```

Which would be parsed and used to fill fields in the Event type. This data becomes available to Mu and Python functions binding to the event. By default the Event object is sent to the insertCreatePixelBlock() function which fins the image source associated with the meda and inserts the data into the correct layer and view of the image. Each of the keywords in the PIXELTILE header is optional.The DATAEVENT message is similar to the PIXELTILE but is intended to be implemented by the user. The message header takes at least three parameters which are ordered (no keywords like PIXELTILE). RV will use only the first three parameters:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| event-name | RV will send a raw data event with this name |
| target | Required but not currently used |
| content type string | An arbitrary string indicating the type of the content. This is available to the UI from the Event.contentType() function. |

Table 13.12:DATAEVENT MessageFor example, the DATAEVENT header might appear as:

```
 DATAEVENT(my-data-event,unused,special-data) 
```
Which would be sent to the user interface as a my-data-event with the content type “special-data”. The content type is retrievable with Event.contentType(). The data payload is available via Event.dataContents() method.
