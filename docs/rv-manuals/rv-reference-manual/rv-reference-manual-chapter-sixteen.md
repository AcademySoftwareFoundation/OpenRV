# Chapter 16 - Node Reference

This chapter has a section for each type of node in RV's image processing graph. The properties and descriptions listed here are the default properties.

Example use case: Using OpenCV to determine lens distort parameters for RVLensWarp node based on GoPro footage. First capture some footage of a checkboard with your GoPro. Then you can use OpenCV camera calibration approach on this footage to solve for k1,k2,k3,p1 and p2. In OpenCV these numbers are reported back as follows. For example our 1920x1440 Hero3 Black GoPro solve returned:

```
    fx=829.122253 0.000000 cx=969.551819
    0.000000 fy=829.122253 cy=687.480774
    0.000000 0.000000 1.000000
    k1=-0.198361 k2=0.028252 p1=0.000092 p2=-0.000073 
```
The OpenCV camera calibration solve output numbers are then translated/normalized to the RVLensWarpode property values as follows:

```
    warp.model = "opencv"
    warp.k1 = k1
    warp.k2 = k2
    warp.p1 = p1
    warp.p2 = p2
    warp.center = [cx/1920 cy/1440]
    warp.fx = fx/1920
    warp.fy = fy/1920 
```
e.g. mu code:

```
    set("#RVLensWarp.warp.model", "opencv");
    set("#RVLensWarp.warp.k1", -0.198361);
    set("#RVLensWarp.warp.k2", 0.028252);
    set("#RVLensWarp.warp.p1", 0.00092);
    set("#RVLensWarp.warp.p2", -0.00073);
    setFloatProperty("#RVLensWarp.warp.offset", float[]{0.505, 0.4774}, true);
    set("#RVLensWarp.warp.fx", 0.43185);
    set("#RVLensWarp.warp.fy", 0.43185); 
```
Example use case: Using Adobe LCP (Lens Camera Profile) distort parameters for RVLensWarp node. Adobe LCP files can be located in '/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CameraRaw/LensProfiles/1.0' under OSX. Adobe LCP file parameters maps to the RVLensWarp node properties as follows:

```
    warp.model = "adobe"
    warp.k1 = stCamera:RadialDistortParam1
    warp.k2 = stCamera:RadialDistortParam2
    warp.k3 = stCamera:RadialDistortParam3
    warp.p1 = stCamera:TangentialDistortParam1
    warp.p2 = stCamera:TangentialDistortParam2
    warp.center = [stCamera:ImageXCenter stCamera:ImageYCenter]
    warp.fx = stCamera:FocalLengthX
    warp.fy = stCamera:FocalLengthY 
```

### OCIO (OpenColorIO), OCIOFile, OCIOLook, and OCIODisplay


OpenColorIO nodes can be used in place of existing RV LUT pipelines. Properties in RVColorPipelineGroup, RVLinearizePipelineGroup, RVLookPipelineGroup, and RVDisplayPipelineGroup determine whether or not the OCIO nodes are used. All OCIO nodes have the same properties and function, but their location in the color pipeline is determined by their type. The exception is the generic OCIO node which can be created by the user and used in any context.NOTE: THIS IS INCOMPLETE – [SEE ACCOMPANYING OCIO INTEGRATION DOCUMENT](../rv-opencolorio-integrations.md)

Overlay nodes can be used with any source. They can be used to draw arbitrary rectangles and text over the source but beneath any annotations. Overlay nodes can hold any number of 3 types of components: **rect** components describe a rectangle to be rendered, **text** components describe a string (or an array of strings, one per frame) to be rendered, and **window** components describe a matted region to be indicated either by coloring the region outside the window, or by outlining it. The coordiates of the corners of the window may be animated by specifying one number per frame.In the below the “ **id** ” in the component name can be any string, but must be different for each component of the same type.

### PipelineGroup, RVDisplayPipelineGroup, RVColorPipelineGroup, RVLinearizePipelineGroup, RVLookPipelineGroup and RVViewPipelineGroup

### RVRetime


Retime nodes are in many of the group nodes to handle any necessary time changes to match playback between sources and views with different native frame rates. You can also use them for “artistic retiming” of two varieties.The properties in the “warp” component (see below) implement a key-framed “speed warping” variety of retiming, where the keys describe the speed (as a multiplicative factor of the target frame rate - so 1.0 implies no difference, 0.5 implies half-speed, and 2.0 implies double-speed) at a given input frame. Or you can provide an explicit map of output frames from input frames with the properties in the “explicit” component (see below). Note that the warping will still make use of what it can of the “standard” retiming properties (in particular the output fps and the visual scale), but if you use explicit retiming, none of the standard properties will have any effect. The “precedence” of the retiming types depends on the active flags: if “explicit.active” is non-zero, the other properties will have no effect., and if there is no explicit retiming, warping will be active if “warp.active” is true. Please note that neither speed warping nor explicit mapping does any retiming of the input audio.

| explicit.active | int | 1 | 1 if an explicit mapping is provided and should be used. |
| explicit.firstOutputFrame | int | 1 | The output frame range provided by the Retime node will start with this frame. The last frame provided will be determined by the length of the array in the “inputFrames” property. |
