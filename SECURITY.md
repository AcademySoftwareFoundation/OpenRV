# Security and Open RV

The Open RV Technical Steering Committee (TSC) takes security very
seriously. We strive to design secure software, and utilize continuous 
integration and code analysis tools to help identify potential 
vulnerabilities.

Users should exercise caution when working with untrusted data (Open RV
session files, external Open RV packages, external Open RV movie and image 
plugins, etc.). Open RV takes every precaution to read only valid data, but it 
would be naive to say our code is immune to every exploit.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

Quickly resolving security related issues is a priority. 
To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenRV/security/advisories/new) tab.

Include detailed steps to reproduce the issue, and any other information that
could aid an investigation. Someone will assess the report and make every
effort to respond within 14 days.
