## Overview

Open RV is an image and sequence viewer for VFX and animation artists.
Open RV is high-performant, hardware accelerated, and pipeline-friendly.

## Cloning the repository

OpenRV uses submodules to pull some dependencies. When cloning the repository, make sure to do it recursively by using
the following command:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenRV.git
```

If you cloned the repo without setting the `--recursive` flag, you can initialize the submodule in another step with the
following command:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Building the workstation

Open RV is currently supported on the following operating systems:

* [Windows 10 and 11](docs/build_system/config_windows.md)
* [macOS Big Sur, Monterey and Ventura](docs/build_system/config_macos.md)
* [Linux Centos 7](docs/build_system/config_linux_centos7.md)
* [Linux Rocky 8](docs/build_system/config_linux_rocky8.md)
* [Linux Rocky 9](docs/build_system/config_linux_rocky9.md)

Support for other operating systems is on a best effort basis.

## Building RV

You can use `source rvcmds.sh` to add common build aliases into your shell. After the first download following the
installation of the required dependencies, use `rvbootstrap` to set up, configure, and build Open RV with the default
options.

After the setup, you can use `rvmk` (the common build alias) to configure and build Open RV. You can also use `rvmkd` to
configure and build in Debug.

On macOS, if you want to build for a different deployment target than your current operating system, make sure to define
the MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET environment variable.

### Contributor setup

This repository uses a pre-commit to execute formatting before a commit. To install the pre-commit hooks:

```shell
pre-commit install
```

### Cleanup

To clean your build directory and restart from a clean slate, use the `rvclean` common build alias, or delete
the `_build` folder.

### Bootstrap

Before first your first Open RV build, you must install some python dependencies.

#### Common build alias

Use the `rvsetup` common build alias to run the bootstrap step.

#### Manually

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

Note that on Windows, use the following command instead from an MSYS2-MinGW64 shell:
```bash
SETUPTOOLS_USE_DISTUTILS=stdlib python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

### Configure

The project uses CMake and requires a `configure` step before building. It is during the configure step that you provide
your Qt package.

From the root of the repository, execute `cmake` and specify the path to an arbitrary build folder and the path to your
QT5 package.

#### Common build alias

Use the `rvcfg` (the common build alias) to run the configuration step. You can also use `rvcfgd` to configure in Debug.

#### Manually

##### Windows

On Windows, you must specify the path to Strawberry perl for the OpenSSL build.

```bash
cmake -B _build -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DRV_DEPS_WIN_PERL_ROOT=/c/Strawberry/perl/bin -DRV_DEPS_QT5_LOCATION=/c/path/to/your/Qt/Root
```

##### Linux and MacOS

```bash
cmake -B _build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DRV_DEPS_QT5_LOCATION=/Path/To/Your/Qt5/Root
```

#### Tips

##### 3rd Parties Outside Of Repository

To keep your third-party builds between build cleanups, set `-DRV_DEPS_BASE_DIR=/path/to/third/party`.

### Build

Invoke the previously specified generator tool using cmake to run the `build` step (recommended).

#### Common build alias

Use the `rvbuild` (the common build alias) to run the build step. You can also use `rvbuildd` to build in Debug.

#### Manually

```bash
cmake --build _build --config Release -v --parallel=8 --target main_executable
```

### Test

Invoke the tests using ctest.

#### Common build alias

Use the `rvtest` common build alias to start the tests.

#### Manually

```shell
ctest --test-dir _build
```

#### Tips

##### Run The Tests In Parallel

You can run the `test` in parallel by specifying `--parallel X`, where X is the number of tests to run in parallel.

##### Run A Subset Of The Tests

You can apply a filter with the `-R` flag to specify a regex.

##### Run The Tests Verbose

You can run the tests with extra verbosity with the flag `--extra-verbose`.

> **Important:** You cannot use `--extra-verbose` with `--parallel`. It's one or the other, not both.

### Run

Once the build ends, you can execute (or debug!) Open RV from the _build directory.

The path to the build is `_build/stage/app`. It contains everything required to have the proper debug symbols.

### Install

Invoke the `install` step using cmake. The install step prepares Open RV for packaging by building a copy of Open RV in
the `_install` folder.

The build system allows you to prepackage Open RV using cmake's `install` command. It will strip debug symbols if
required.

Then, it's up to you to either sign or package the result, or to do both. It should contain the minimum required to have
a functional Open RV.

#### Common build alias

Use the `rvinst` common build alias to install OpenRV.

#### Manually

```shell
cmake --install _build --prefix _install
```
