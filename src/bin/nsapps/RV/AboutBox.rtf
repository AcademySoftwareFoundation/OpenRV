\'95			(2)\'a0If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group".\
\'95			(3)\'a0Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sa280\partightenfactor0
\cf0 These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code, not just to the unmodified library. If you use our work, you ought to acknowledge us.\
Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from it. This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's software".\
We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are assumed by the product vendor.\
ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally, that you must include source code if you redistribute it. (See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.) However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do.\
The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltconfig, ltmain.sh). Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.\
It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Hence arithmetic coding cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses. For this reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software. (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.) So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining code.\
The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce "uncompressed GIFs". This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.\
We are required to state that\uc0\u8232 "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated."\

Introduction\
============\
\
  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;\
  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,\
  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the\
  FreeType Project.\
\
  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and\
  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license\
  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,\
  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.\
\
  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG\
  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion\
  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products\
  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:\
\
    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be\
      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)\
\
    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or\
      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)\
\
    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use\
      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge\
      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the\
      FreeType code. (`credits')\
\
  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this\
  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.\
  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and\
  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.\
\
\
  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a\
  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus\
  encourage you to use the following text:\
\
   """\
    Portions of this software are copyright \'a9 <year> The FreeType\
    Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.\
   """\
\
  Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you\
  actually use.\
\
\
Legal Terms\
===========\
\
0. Definitions\
--------------\
\
  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',\
  and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally\
  distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and\
  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,\
  beta or final release.\
\
  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where\
  `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source\
  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.\
  This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType\
  engine'.\
\
  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original\
  FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and\
  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its\
  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.\
  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by\
  this license, you must contact us to verify this.\
\
  The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,\
  Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as\
  specified below.\
\
1. No Warranty\
--------------\
\
  THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY\
  KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,\
  WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR\
  PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS\
  BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO\
  USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.\
\
2. Redistribution\
-----------------\
\
  This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and\
  irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,\
  display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and\
  sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code\
  forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to\
  authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted\
  herein, subject to the following conditions:\
\
    o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file\
      (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to\
      the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying\
      documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,\
      original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source\
      files.\
\
    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that\
      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the\
      FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also\
      encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your\
      documentation, though this isn't mandatory.\
\
  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on\
  the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use\
  our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid\
  to us.\
\
3. Advertising\
--------------\
\
  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use\
  the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional\
  purposes without specific prior written permission.\
\
  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the\
  following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation\
  or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',\
  `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.\
\
  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to\
  accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted\
  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the\
  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.\
  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType\
  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms\
  of this license.\
\
4. Contacts\
-----------\
\
  There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:\
\
    o freetype@nongnu.org\
\
      Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as\
      future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution.\
      If  you are looking  for support,  start in  this list  if you\
      haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.\
\
    o freetype-devel@nongnu.org\
\
      Discusses bugs,  as well  as engine internals,  design issues,\
      specific licenses, porting, etc.\

This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane. All Rights Reserved except as specified below.\
\
Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these conditions:\
\
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.\
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group".\
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.\
These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code, not just to the unmodified library. If you use our work, you ought to acknowledge us.\
\
Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from it. This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's software".\
\
We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are assumed by the product vendor.\
\
ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally, that you must include source code if you redistribute it. (See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.) However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do.\
\
The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltconfig, ltmain.sh). Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.\
\
It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Hence arithmetic coding cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses. For this reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software. (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.) So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining code.\
\
The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce "uncompressed GIFs". This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.\
\
We are required to state that \
"The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated."\

CC0 1.0 Universal\
CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN \'93AS-IS\'94 BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER.\
Statement of Purpose\
The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an \'93owner\'94) of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a \'93Work\'94).\
Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works (\'93Commons\'94) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.\
For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the \'93Affirmer\'94), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.\

Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer\'92s Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \'93Waiver\'94). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer\'92s heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer\'92s express Statement of Purpose.\

Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer\'92s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer\'92s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \'93License\'94). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer\'92s express Statement of Purpose.\

\ls82\ilvl0\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 {\listtext	c.	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person\'92s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.

CC0 1.0 Universal\
CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN \'93AS-IS\'94 BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER.\
Statement of Purpose\
The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an \'93owner\'94) of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a \'93Work\'94).\
Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works (\'93Commons\'94) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.\
For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the \'93Affirmer\'94), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.\

Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer\'92s Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \'93Waiver\'94). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer\'92s heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer\'92s express Statement of Purpose.\

Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer\'92s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer\'92s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \'93License\'94). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer\'92s express Statement of Purpose.\

      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\
\
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including\
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"\
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent\
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to\
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,\
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the\
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but\
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise\
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."\
\
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity\
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and\
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.\
\
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,\
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the\
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\
\
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\
      as of the date such litigation is filed.\
\
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\
      meet the following conditions:\
\
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\
\
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\
          stating that You changed the files; and\
\
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\
          the Derivative Works; and\
\
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\
          as modifying the License.\
\
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\
      the conditions stated in this License.\
\
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\
\
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor\
      and its affiliates, except as required to comply with Section 4(c) of\
      the License and to reproduce the content of the NOTICE file.\
\
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\
\
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\
\
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\

\
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical\
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but\
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,\
      and conversions to other media types.\
\
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or\
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a\
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work\
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\
\
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\
\
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including\
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"\
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent\
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to\
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,\
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the\
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but\
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise\
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."\
\
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity\
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and\
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.\
\
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,\
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the\
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\
\
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\
      as of the date such litigation is filed.\
\
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\
      meet the following conditions:\
\
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\
\
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\
          stating that You changed the files; and\
\
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\
          the Derivative Works; and\
\
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\
          as modifying the License.\
\
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\
      the conditions stated in this License.\
\
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\
\
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor\
      and its affiliates, except as required to comply with Section 4(c) of\
      the License and to reproduce the content of the NOTICE file.\
\
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\
\
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\
\
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\
