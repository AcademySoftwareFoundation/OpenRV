    <p>
    This package is based on the
    <a href="http://opentimeline.io">OTIO</a>
    project
    </p>

    <h3>
    Overview
    </h3>

    <p>
    The OTIO Reader is an RV package that will allow an otio file to be imported
    into RV. The package is installed and loaded by default with support for all
    OTIO schemas present as of OTIO version 0.14. So no action is required by
    users to import these through any of the various RV import paths.
    </p>

    <p>
    The rest of this section will detail how the import can be customized and
    how to support custom OTIO schemas or metadata.
    </p>

    <h3>
    Package contents
    </h3>

    <p>
    The RV package is installed in the usual python package installation location,
    which is the <code>PlugIns/Python</code> folder in the installation directory. There are
    also a number of other files used by the package in the
    <code>Plugins/SupportFiles/otio_reader</code> directory which are detailed below.

    A for handling the Effect schema.
    </p>

    </p>
    </li>

    <li>
    <p>
    timeWarpHook.py
    A hook for importing OTIO&#39;s LinearTimeWarp and FreezeFrame schemas.
    </p>
    </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
    Using the OTIO hook system
    </h3>

    <p>
    The RV package is using the existing OTIO hook system to execute its hooks, so
    any existing manifest.json in the <code>OTIO_PLUGIN_MANIFEST_PATH</code> environment
    variable can be modified to work with RV&#39;s hook system, including RV&#39;s own
    manifest.json.
    </p>

    <p>
    There are three types of OTIO hooks that will be called by the RV package:
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li>
    pre- and post-hooks
    </li>
    
    <li>
    custom schema hooks
    </li>
    
    <li>
    custom transition hook
    </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    The pre- and post-hooks are called before each known OTIO schema. They are named
    <code>pre_hook_[schema_name]</code> and <code>post_hook_[schema_name]</code> and will be called just
    before and just after processing the schema. For example, a hook can be added
    named <code>pre_hook_Clip</code> and it will be called just before the 
    <code>otio_reader</code> has created an RV source based on the Clip. These hooks are 
    useful for handling custom metadata in schemas. The provided <code>clipHook.py</code> 
    is an example of this.
    </p>

    <p>
    The custom schema hooks are called whenever a schema that is not handled
    by the <code>otio_reader</code> is encountered. These hooks are named 
    <code>[schema_name]_to_rv</code>. For example, <code>CDL_to_rv</code> will be called whenever a schema
    named <code>CDL</code> is found. The provided <code>cdlHook.py</code> is an example of this. This is 
    most commonly used for custom effects and other schemas that are not provided 
    by OTIO. 
    </p>

    <p>
    The custom transition hook is similar to the custom schema hooks, except instead
    of being based on the schema name, it is called whenever the <code>transition_type</code> 
    field of the Transition schema is set to <code>Custom</code>. The
    <code>customTransitionHook.py</code> is an example of this.
    </p>

    <h4>
    Hook file parameters
    </h4>

    <p>
    The <code>in_timeline</code> paraemter in the OTIO hook functions will be set to the OTIO
    schema being processed, not the full timeline.  For example, in <code>cdlHook.py</code>
    the <code>in_timeline</code> is the CDL effect and in the <code>pre_hook_Clip</code> it is the Clip.
    </p>

    <p>
    The <code>argument_map</code> will contain the context that can be helpful when creating 
    RV nodes.  For example, the following keys can currently be present, depending
    on which hook is being called:
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li>
    <p><code>transition</code>
    RV transition output node
    </p>
    </li>

    <li>
    <p><code>stack</code>
    RVStackGroup output node
    </p>
    </li>

    <li>
    <p><code>sequence</code>
    RVSequenceGroup output node
    </p>
    </li>

    <li>
    <p><code>source</code>
    RVSource output node
    </p>
    </li>

    <li><p><code>source_group</code>
    RVSourceGroup output node</p>
    </li>

    <li>
    <p><code>track_kind</code>
    OTIO <code>track_kind</code> property of the OTIO Track currently being processed
    </p>
    </li>

    <li>
    <p><code>global_start_time</code>
    The <code>global_start_time</code> of the OTIO Timeline.
    </p>
    </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>
    Hook file return values
    </h4>

    <p>
    When RV nodes are being created, such as effects or transitions, the return
    value should be set to the name of the created node.  The <code>otio_reader</code> will
    add the node as input at the current location in RV&#39;s node graph. It will also
    have its metadata added as a new property on the node named <code>otio.metadata</code>.
    </p>
     
    <p>
    For pre- and post- hooks, no return value is expected.
    </p>
