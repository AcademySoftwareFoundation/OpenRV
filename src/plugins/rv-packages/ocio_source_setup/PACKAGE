    <p>
    This mode is intended as a starting point for facility specific
    OpenColorIO workflows. 
    </p>

    <p>
    This mode integrates both with the base RV source_setup package and
    OCIO. The idea is that incoming source media is first examined by the
    base setup package then when appropriate, this package will switch the
    source to use OCIO. If any source uses OCIO, then we attempt to use OCIO
    with the display.
    </p>

    <p>
    Display and view changes are applied independently to each displays under
    the appropriate menu for each device. 
    </p>

    <p>
    By default this package will use GetCurrentConfig() to find your OCIO
    config from the environment and then use config.parseColorSpaceFromString()
    on individual sources to lookup colorspace transforms.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you want to customize this behavior without rewriting the timing or
    RV OCIONode setting specifics you can instead author a rv_ocio_setup.py
    Python file and put that in any of the Python directories on the
    $RV_SUPPORT_PATH. Then ocio_source_setup.py will locate that file and look
    for two potential functions defined within; ocio_config_from_media, and/or
    ocio_node_from_media
    </p>

    <p>
    If either of these functions are found during the search they will be used
    in place of the default implementations found at the top of the 
    ocio_source_setup.py file. However you can define both, either, or neither
    and ocio_source_setup.py will just fall back to the default as needed.
    </p>

    <p>ocio_config_from_media</p>
    <p>inputs</p>
    <ul>
    <li>media: media from RVFileSource</li>
    <li>attributes: dictionary of RV collected metadata</li>
    </ul>
    <p>returns</p>
    <ul>
    <li>config: OCIO config object</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    This function is called when ocio_source_setup.py is looking for the OCIO
    config you want to use. It is called with input media and any metadata
    known about that source, and expects in return the OCIO config. The default
    implementation of this function (which you can see at the top of
    ocio_source_setup.py) is to check for the config from the $OCIO environment
    variable.
    </p>

    <p>ocio_node_from_media</p>
    <p>inputs</p>
    <ul>
    <li>config: OCIO config object</li>
    <li>node: instance name of the pipeline group node being evaluated</li>
    <li>default: a list of the nodes normally found in this pipeline group</li>
    <li>[optional] media: media from RVFileSource</li>
    <li>[optional] attributes: dictionary of RV collected metadata</li>
    </ul>
    <p>returns</p>
    <ul>
    <li>An ordered list of dictionaries with the following keys:
        <ul>
        <li>nodeType: type of node at this index of the new pipeline (Usually
        one of the OCIO types)</li>
        <li>context: dictionary of key/value pairs that will be set in the OCIO
        context</li>
        <li>properties: dictionary of ocio.PROP/value pairs that will be
        updated on the OCIO node</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    This function is called when ocio_source_setup.py is attempting to update
    the settings for the display, source look, or source linearization pipeline
    groups with OCIO implementations. Given the OCIO config, pipeline node, and
    the default pipeline membership (as well as the media and its source
    attributes when avaialble) this function should inform the setup process as
    to how the OCIO node properties and context should be set as well as
    provied the new pipeline membership.
    </p>

    <p>
    Please read the top of ocio_source_setup.py for default implementations of
    both functions.
    </p>
