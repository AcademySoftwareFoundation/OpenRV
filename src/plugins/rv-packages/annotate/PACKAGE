  <p> Annotation mode adds simple drawing with undo/redo per frame. The
  drawings are stored in the session directly and can be rendered via rvio.

  Annotation can be started via the Tools menu. A drawing palette will be
  visible and can be optionally attached to the main RV window. The drawing
  palette consists of three sections: the tool mode, the current color and
  opacity, and history actions.
