defineMinorMode """
Creates a (low level) minor mode and space for associated event
tables. The name is assigned to the mode. A mode at this level is an
object with the following attributes:

 * Name
 * Set of named event tables
 * Sort key and order number
 * Menu 

When a mode is active its menu is merged into the main menu of the
application and its event tables are used to handle events. The order
in which the mode's event tables are scanned is determined by the sort
key and the order number. The modes are sorted lexically using the
sort key; if two modes have the same sort key, then the order value is
used as the key the modes with common sort keys.

There are two types of modes: major and minor. There can be any number
of minor modes active at a time but only a single major mode, and the
active major mode has higher precedence than any minor mode when
scanning event tables (i.e. the major mode gets events first).

Each mode can have multiple named event tables which can be activated
independently as long as the mode itself is active. The activation
history of event tables is a stack which can be pushed and poped. Its
also possible to deactive them in any order if needed.

Each event table has a bounding box. The bounding box is only used
with pointer events or events that have a screen location. Only events
with a location that falls inside of the bounding box are considered.

bindings """
Returns a array of tuples of all currently active bound events and the
assocated documentation. This returns events from all currently active

"""

bind """
Bind an event function to an event. If a the named event table does
not yet exist in the specified mode it is created. 

An event function must have the signature: (void; Event). The Event
object can be querried and state can be set on it in response to the
event. If the event function does not call the reject() function on
the event object, then the event is considered accepted and no further
matching event functions will be called. If, on the other hand,
reject() is called and another function is bound to the same event,
then it will also be called. This process continues until reject() is
not called (the event is accepted) or all bound event functions have
been called.

The description string should indicate succinctly (i.e. a sentence or
less) what the event function does.

the mode is inactive the menu is not part of the main menu.

Setting the strict option to true will replace the menu instead of
merging with an existing menu of the same name.
"""

pushEventTable """
For all currently active modes, the named event table will be pushed
onto the event table stack. Since the new table is at the top of the
stack, it will be considered before any other event table. 

Event tables of the same name are merged together such that the mode
ordering determines binding precedence. Table ordering is determined
by the event table stack. Tables at the top of the stack can shadow
tables lower on the stack.

The event table stack is used to implement prefix keys. E.g. when a
prefix key is pressed it causes a specific event table to be pushed to
the top of stack thus overriding existing bindings. When the prefix
actions are complete the table is popped off the stack.
"""

popEventTable """
Causes the top of the event table stack to be popped off the

removed from the event table stack without further changing the
ordering of the stack.

frame "Return the current global frame number"

metaEvaluate """
This function scans the internal IP graph in the same manner that the
renderer does, but does not evaluate images in the process. Instead,
it records the names and evaluation input parameters for each node as
it is traversed in evaluation order. 

The frame passed in is usually the current frame, but can be any valid
global frame number.

You can optionally specify a root and leaf node between which the
meta-evaluation occcurs. By default it will use the root of the graph
and all leaves.

The function returns an array of MetaEvalInfo structures. 
"""

metaEvaluateClosestByType """
This function is similar to metaEvaluate() in that it scans the graph
in evaluation order. However, this function will stop scanning
branches in the IP graph when it encounters a node of type typeName.

The frame passed in is usually the current frame, but can be any valid
global frame number.

The optional root argument causes the function to start scanning at
that node instead of the true root of the graph. 

This behavior is similar to how the set*Property() functions decide
which node to use when given a type name instead of node name. E.g. 
`setIntProperty("#RVColor.lut.active", int[] {1})` . In that case, all 
"nearby" RVColor nodes are modified.
"""

closestNodesOfType """
This function will scan the graph in input order (determined by
scaning inputs in order) from the given root node or the current view
node if none is specified.

When a node matching the given type is found, and the depth is 0, the
branch will stop being searched for additional nodes and the next
branch will be searched.

For depth greater than 0, the function will continue searching
branches until N nodes of the type are found where N is the depth + 1.

Basically, this function is useful to find the nearest nodes to the
view node of a given type without worrying about evaluation order. So
in that sense it is similar to `metaEvaluateClosestByType()` . For
example this function is useful to find the nearest `RVPaint` nodes to
modify for annotation or to find the nearest transform nodes that
would be modifiable for a transform manipulator.
"""

mapPropertyToGlobalFrames """
This function performs an inverse mapping of frame numbers stored in a
property of a node to global frames in the current view. 

For example if you need to know the global frame corresponding to the local
frame 100 of media in a source node you can use this function. In this case an
int property on the source node needs to be created and set to the value 100.
In the simplist case, calling the function with the appropriate path to the
property will return an array containing a single value -- the global frame
corresponding to frame 100.   Note that in the more general case a single
source frame can correspond to any number of global frames.

The maxDepth argument can be used to limit the complexity of the
search -- this is useful if you know that more than one node in the
evaluation path has the given property. 

The optional root argument can be used to map to frames relative to
the given root instead of the true root of the graph. In that case the
returned frame numbers may not be "global" frames.

It is also possible to add a source media representation in RV without calling
the addSourceMediaRep() command by specifying the "mediaRepName" and "mediaRepSource" 
options to the addSources(), addSourceVerbose(), or addSourcesVerbose() commands.

Example:

rv.commands.addSourcesVerbose(["image_sequence.195-215#.jpg", "+mediaRepName", "Frames", "+mediaRepSource", "last"])

by name.
When sourceNode is "all", then the media in all the Switch nodes created with 
the rvc.addSourceMediaRep() command is swapped with the media representation 
specified by name.

"""

setProgressiveSourceLoading """
Turn on/off progressive source loading

Default=false unless 
overridden on the command line with -progressiveSourceLoading 1 
or 
via the RV_PROGRESSIVE_SOURCE_LOADING environment variable

progressiveSourceLoading() can be used to inquire the current progressive source loading state.

Note: this command affects the behaviour of the following scripting commands:
addSource(), addSources(), addSourceVerbose(), addSourcesVerbose().

When progressive source loading is disabled (default), the sources are loaded synchronously.
You can expect this sequence of events:
1) before-progressive-loading
2) source-group-complete media 1
3) source-group-complete media 2
4) after-progressive-loading

When progressive source loading is enabled, the sources are loaded asynchronously by following these steps:
1. RV creates a movie placeholder in the graph called a movieProxie which has a default duration of 20 frames.
2. It dispatches the actual loading of the media as a work item to a pool of worker threads.
3. Once the media completes the loading operation, the movieProxie placeholder is replaced with the actual movie.

You can expect this sequence of events:
1) before-progressive-loading
2) before-progressive-proxy-loading
3) source-group-proxy-complete media_1
4) source-group-proxy-complete media_2
5) after-progressive-proxy-loading
6) source-group-complete media 1
7) source-group-complete media 2
8) after-progressive-loading

Note that enabling progressive source loading changes the way you need to approach your scripts.

To illustrate this point, let's consider the following example:
rv.commands.addSource('/my/clip/1')
rv.commands.setFPS(60.00)

When progressive source loading is disabled (default), the script will behave as expected : the source will be loaded and the frame rate will be set to 60 fps.

When progressive source loading is enabled however, the source will be loaded asynchronously, the frame rate will be set momentarily to 60 fps, and then it will be set to the source native frame rate once the source is loaded.
When using this progressive source loading to increase the responsiveness of the app, you’ll now need to call the FPS set on the “after-progressive-loading” event to ensure loading is complete before setting a property. This will ensure that you can benefit from the feature while also ensuring your code runs correctly.

To unpack a settings value use pattern matching:

----
let SettingsValue.Float f = SettingsValue.Float(1.23);

readSetting """
Read a value from the user's settings (preferences) file. The function returns a 
SettingsValueType (a union) which must be unpacked. The group and name parameters
specify the full path to the settings value. The value parameters supplies a default
value and type to return if the setting doesn't exist in the file. The type of the 
setting value in the file must match the type of the default value passed in to
the function.

For example:

----
let SettingsValue.Bool b = 
        readSetting("mygroup", "foo", SettingsValue.Bool(false));
----

will search for a boolean setting value "foo" in "mygroup". If it does not exist,
the symbol "b" will have the value false. Otherwise it will have the value from the
settings file. There are a few possible types that can be passed to and returned
from readSetting:

Note that you need to use a "let" pattern matching expression to pull the
value out of a SettingsValue.

"""

writeSetting """
Write a value to the user's settings (preferences) file. The group and name parameters
