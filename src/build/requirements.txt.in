# This file contains all the packages that will be packaged with RV. Please add the license next to the package.
# NOTE: This is a CMake template file. The actual requirements.txt is generated during CMake configuration.
#       To update OpenTimelineIO version, edit RV_DEPS_OTIO_VERSION in cmake/defaults/CYCOMMON.cmake
#       To update NumPy version, edit RV_DEPS_NUMPY_VERSION in cmake/defaults/CY*.cmake
# NOTE: By default, all packages are built from source to ensure proper ABI compatibility with our custom Python.
#       Pure Python packages safe to install from wheels are listed in RV_PYTHON_WHEEL_SAFE in python3.cmake.
#       This approach ensures safety by default: new packages will be built from source unless explicitly marked as wheel-safe.
