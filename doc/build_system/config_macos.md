1. [Invoke CMake](#build-including-incremental-builds)

## Install XCode

From the App Store, download XCode. Make sure that it's the source of the active developer directory.

`xcode-select -p` should return `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`. If it's not the case, run `sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app`

## Install Homebrew

Homebrew is the one stop shop providing all the build requirements. You can install it following the instructions on the [Homebrew page](https://brew.sh).

Make sure Homebrew's binary directory is in your PATH and that `brew` is resolved from your terminal.

## Install tools and build dependencies

Most of the build requirements can be installed by running the following brew install command:

```bash
brew install cmake ninja readline sqlite3 xz zlib tcl-tk autoconf automake libtool python yasm clang-format black meson nasm pkg-config glew
```

Make sure `python` resolves in your terminal. In some case, depending on how the python formula is built, there's no `python` symbolic link.
In that case, you can create one with this command `ln -s python3 $(dirname $(which python3))/python`.

## Install the python requirements

Some of the RV build scripts requires extra python packages. They can be installed using the requirements.txt at the root of the repository.

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

## Install Qt

Download the last version of Qt 5.15.x that you can get using the online installer on the [Qt page](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source). Logs, Android, iOS and WebAssembly are not required to build OpenRV.


WARNING: If you decide fetch Qt from another source, make sure to build it with SSL support and that  it contains everything required to build PySide2 and that the file structure is similar to the official package.
FYI. Qt5 from homebrew is known to not work well with OpenRV.

## Configure

The project uses CMake and requires a configure step before building. It is during the configure step that you provide your Qt package.

From the root of the repository, execute `cmake` specifying the path to an arbitrary build folder and the path to your QT5 package.

For example:

```bash
cmake -B cmake-build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DRV_DEPS_QT5_LOCATION=$HOME/Qt/5.15.2/clang_64
```

### Custom generator

You can decide to build with another generator. Ninja is known to work well with the build. If you desire to build with Ninja, you can set`-G Ninja`

## Build (including incremental builds)

Invoke the build tool using cmake (recommended).

For example

```bash
cmake --build cmake-build --target RV
```
